so we have to ignore the .html files in /public because all of it will now be converted into .ejs files and will be moved to /views folder 
EXCEPT index.html file 

api.js or app.js is our entry point for the api 

so basically, what we have to do is render the editable file's data using ejs but when we have to send the file 
we will have to do string manipulation in order to create files, this will also be generated on the server using the files in the /server folder
